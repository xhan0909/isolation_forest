# Isolation Forest Algorithm from Scratch

*Original paper: https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/zhouzh.files/publication/icdm08b.pdf*

This is the course project of MSDS689 - Data Structure and Algorithms, designed by Professor Terence Parr. The goal of this project is to implement the original Isolation Forest algorithm by Fei Tony Liu, Kai Ming Ting, and Zhi-Hua Zhou (link is shown above) from scratch to better understand this commonly implemented approach for anomaly detection.  

## Dataset  

Below is one of the data sets I used to test the algorithm:  
+ [Kaggle credit card fraud competition data set](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)  

## Visualization of normal versus anomaly separation
